We might not know the result of laziness and procrastination in a few
days and even a month. We only see the result after many years, when
things can no longer be changed. Butterfly is one of the humble
creators we have on earth, despite their beauty. Learn to be humble no
matter how much you have achieved in life. Life is not all sweet and
rosy. It is tough at times. The tough moments in life make it
interesting. Life will be boring if there are no challenges to
tackle. Your mind is powerful. It controls your actions, words and
your general outlook on life. So, fill it with things which are
invaluable. We always forget about death when alive, so, when death
comes it meet us unawares. If we always remember death we will think
more before taking many of the steps we take. You owe no one an
apology. You owe no one an explanation. You should live your life
outside the definition of people.
