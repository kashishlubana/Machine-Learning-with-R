We can interpret the data by using the above result 

As we can see that pr(>F) is very less and less than 0.05 we can say that diet has a significant effect on weight loss and also the F value is high

For 74 observation it was not calculated
```{r}
str(diet)
diet$weight_loss = as.factor(diet$weight_loss)

diet$Diet = as.factor(diet$Diet)



str(diet)
TukeyHSD(anova,conf.level = 0.95)

```
